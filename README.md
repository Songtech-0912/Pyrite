# Pyrite

![](https:///via.placeholder.com/1920x1080?text=Demo+Screenshot.png)

A fast and beautiful editor, powered by `Eel` and `Python`. Download it and try it out [here](release_notes/release-0.1.1-alpha.md).

## Overview

Pyrite's name sounds like "PyWrite" - because it's designed from the ground up for writing code. Unlike electron-based editors, it doesn't suffer from node package bloat. And, unlike most widget-based editors, its UI is polished and themable. 

Here's what PyRite offers:

* Fast file opening speeds, even on very large files (More testing needed to verify this!) 

* Minimal memory use

* File autosaving (Will come soon!)

* Syntax highlighting of most languages (Will come soon!)

* Support for multiple themes (Will come soon!)

* Minimalist and distraction-free feature set

### Built with

* HTML & CSS (no SASS or LESS)
  
* Mostly (>96%) vanilla javascript, with no libraries (except for `keyboard.js`)
  
* Python & `Eel`

### FAQ

* How is Pyrite different from an editor that I'm used to?

Unlike most text editors, the main point of using Pyrite isn't to have all the best and coolest features. Instead, it's meant to be distraction-free and minimalist. It makes you focus on the code that you're writing, *not* what you write the code with.

* Why is \<insert feature here\> not available?

Pyrite is *designed* to be extremely minimal, with very few configuration options. With that being said though, many features (e.g. find and replace) will come in the future releases.

* What are the keybindings?

There are (as of now) three custom (Pyrite-specific) keyboard shortcuts:

**Save:** `Alt S`

**Save Copy:** `Alt C`

**Create New:** `Alt N`

In addition, these generic keyboard functions will also work:

**Undo:** `Ctrl Z`

**Redo:** `Ctrl Shift Z`

**Copy:** `Ctrl C`

**Cut:** `Ctrl X`

**Paste:** `Ctrl V`

**Select All:**  `Ctrl A`

* I want to use Pyrite for my own projects. Can I do that?

Yes, sure! Because Pyrite is free and open-source software, you're more than welcome to use it for personal purposes. You can even sell it, as long as you place no limitations upon its use.
