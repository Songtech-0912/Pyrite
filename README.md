A fast and beautiful editor, powered by `Eel` and `Python`

## Overview

Pyrite's name sounds like "PyWrite" - because it's designed from the ground up for writing code. Unlike electron-based editors, it doesn't suffer from node package bloat. And, unlike most widget-based editors, its UI is polished and themable. 

Here's what PyRite offers:

* Syntax highlighting of most languages

* File autosaving

* Fast file opening speeds, even on very large files

* Minimal memory use

* Support for multiple themes

* Minimalist and distraction-free
