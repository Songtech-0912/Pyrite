# Pre-Release 0.1.1 alpha

## TL;DR

* This release is for mainly for previewing purposes
* Pyrite is nowhere near production-ready (but basic functionalities should work)
* Help the project by trying our Pyrite and reporting bugs

## Download it

* [Linux]()
* [MacOS]()
* [Windows (64-bit)]()

You can find all of these, and other downloads, on the [releases page]().

## Notes

This is Pyrite's **first** release, intended as a proof-of-concept for the concept. It's a *very* eary release, so bugs are expected...well, practically everywhere. There is a lot that has to be done:

* Code errors need to be fixed
* JavaScript code refactoring needs to be done (because some functions are over 50 lines long)
* Implement more of `Eel`'s native APIs to make it a true desktop application (because Pyrite is heavily dependent on web APIs at the moment)

In addition, the features are limited:

* Due to browser permission issues, pasting text may behave erratically
* There is no option to rename files
* Saving files is a very cumbersome process
* No syntax highlighting/code indentation/autocomplete yet
* UI design is not totally fleshed out

With all that being said, feel free to try Pyrite out! If you find any bugs, please report them on Github immediately ([here's how](#reporting-issues)). It would help greatly in the development process. 

In addition, from this point on, I will continue to release a new version of Pyrite every 2 weeks (if all goes well). I want everyone to test out Pyrite, not just programmers experienced in getting and compiling code.
